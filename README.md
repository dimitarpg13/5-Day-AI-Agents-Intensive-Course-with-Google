# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

Welcome! This repository contains my personal notes, code, and solutions for the **5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course** hosted by Google.

This 5-day online program, crafted by Google’s ML researchers and engineers, helps developers explore the foundations and practical applications of AI agents.

## Course Overview

The curriculum is designed to move from foundational concepts to building production-ready systems. Each day blends conceptual deep dives, hands-on codelabs, and live discussions.

**Key concepts covered:**

  * Core agent components: **Models, Tools, Orchestration, Memory, and Evaluation**.
  * Agent Ops: Reliability, governance, and security.
  * Practical application: Building agents with the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini**.
  * Interoperability: Using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for complex, long-running operations.

## Technologies & Tools

  * **Core Model:** Google Gemini
  * **Framework:** Agent Development Kit (ADK)
  * **Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  * **Platform:** Kaggle (for Codelabs)
  * **Language:** Python

## Daily Assignments & Curriculum

This section tracks the daily assignments and materials from the course.

### Day 1: Introduction to Agents

  * **Topic:** Introduces a taxonomy of agent capabilities, the need for an "Agent Ops" discipline, and the importance of interoperability and security.
  * **Whitepaper:** [Introduction to Agents](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/5-Day-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-with-Google/blob/main/Day%201/whitepaper/Day_1_v4.pdf)

  * **Codelabs (Kaggle):**
    1.  [Build your first agent using Gemini and ADK](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-1a-from-prompt-to-action)
    2.  [Build your first multi-agent systems using ADK](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-1b-agent-architectures)
  * **Resources:**
      * [Codelab Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)
      * **Note:** Kaggle account phone verification is required for codelabs.

### Day 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability (MCP)

  * **Topic:** Focuses on external tools and functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data. Introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for complex operations.
  * **Whitepaper:** [Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/5-Day-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-with-Google/blob/main/Day%202/whitepaper/Day_2_v6.pdf)

    1.  [Implement Sessions to manage immediate context in your agents](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-3a-agent-sessions)
    2.  [Implement Memory to create long-term, personalized experiences](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-3b-agent-memory)

### Day 4: Agent Quality

  * **Topics:** Focuses on agent quality assurance using a holistic evaluation framework. Covers the technical foundation of Observability (Logs, Traces, Metrics) and scalable feedback loops like LLM-as-a-Judge and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL).
  * **Whitepaper:** [Agent Quality](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/5-Day-AI-Agents-Intensive-Course-with-Google/blob/main/Day%204/whitepaper/Day_4.pdf)
  * **Podcast:** [Unit 4 Summary (via NotebookLM)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFQRy-Ci-lk)
